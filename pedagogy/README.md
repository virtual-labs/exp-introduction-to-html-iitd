#### 1. Focus Area : <br>Reinforce theoretical concept
The students know the concept of HTML. They do revise the working of HTML tags through simulator.<br>
#### Experimentation
After understanding the concepts of HTML and working of HTML tags students perform experiments of HTML tags in Simulator. They do write code for different HTML tags in Write Code Section and preview the output in Output Section.
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :  <u> Guided Inquiry 
###### Assessment Method: Summative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 The objectives along with the theory of HTML are already explained and given. The students are asked to propose a methodology for creating an HTML document based on the theory given, to address the objectives leading to results and conclusions in the form a web page.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task<br/>

1.| Click on the "Pop-Up procedure" button to understand the steps for performing the experiment. |Show the procedure for performing the experiment through the given link. | To let student understand the procedure for performing the experiment.<br/>
2.| Inspect the given buttons for different tags of an HTML document.  | Provides different tags respective buttons | To let student understand different tags of an HTML document.<br/>
3.| Mouseover on the respective button for different tags of an HTML document.  | Show output for different tags of  HTML elements.   |To let student  identify the output for different tags of an HTML document.<br/>
4.| Click on the respective button for different tags of an HTML document.  | Show the syntax of each tag for which button is clicked. | To understand, what is the proper syntax for each tag of HTML.<br/>
5.| After understanding the syntax for each of the tag, write the code for the same in the section given in the Simulator. | Provide a code window for writing code. | To let the student learn how to write code.<br/>
6.| See and rectify the errors made during writing the code. | Highlight the errors made in the code. | To let student do the mistakes and rectify them for effective learning.<br/>
7.| Preview result of the HTML code written.| Display the result of the code.  | To let the student see the result of the code when the right code is written. <br/>
8.| Use the clear screen button to clear the code screen in the window. |Erase the code from the screen. | To allow student to write another code.

1. The experiment begins with previewing the output of different tags in "Preview Section" given at the top by hovering the cursor in the "Tag Button Section" given.

2. After preview, click on any of the "Tag Button" to see the syntax of that particular tag in adjacent the "Syntax Section".

3. After understanding the syntax, start writing code for that particular tag in the "Write Code Section" given at the left bottom.

4. If there will be any error in the code, then the simulator will highlight that error so that it can be rectified.
